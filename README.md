# neatnumbersgs

When developing a modal Dialog for google-apps-script, I've faced a problem.
Some numbers where bigger than 999, some much bigger, and they were displayed clumsy.

That's where the idea of neatnumbersgs came in, as a way to display numbers with any favorite thousands or decimal separators.

The stuff that matters is in the [neat.gs](/neat.gs) file.
